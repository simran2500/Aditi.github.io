    <h1>Happy Birthday to <mark>My Pokie</mark> and other's <i>Aditi Dogra</i></h1>

    <p>
I honestly don’t know how the universe decided to bless me with a best friend like you — equal parts chaos, comfort, and completely unfiltered commentary. You've been there through every mental breakdown, questionable decision, and 2 a.m. deep talk… usually with snacks and sarcasm ready.
You’re not just my best friend — you're my unpaid therapist, emergency contact, and personal clown all rolled into one (seriously, you deserve an award).
Thank you for always being real, for laughing till we cry, and for sticking around even when I’m annoying (which is often). Life with you is messier, louder, and a whole lot more beautiful.
Here’s to another year of inside jokes, spontaneous plans, bad ideas, and unshakeable friendship. I love you more than memes and coffee combined — and that’s saying something. 💖🎉
